    <h1>Associations</h1>
        <p>Below are a list of professional organizations that I plan to join in the future.</p>

        <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://www.ala.org/">The American Library Association</a> - The ALA is an important professional association with information about being a librarian in the US. This would be an important association for me to join. </li>
            <li> <a href="https://www.ala.org/pla/">The Public Library Association</a> - This is a branch of the American Library Association specifically for public librarians, and I plan to work in a public library in the future.  </li>
            <li> <a href="https://www.njla.org/">The New Jersey Library Association</a> - Although I am not yet sure if I will be working in New Jersey or Pennsylvania in the future, I am currently interning in New Jersey, so if I continued working where I am it would be beneficial to be part of the New Jersey Library Association.</li>
            <li> <a href="https://www.ala.org/alsc/ ">The Association for Library Service to Children</a> - b.	I plan on working with children or young adults in my future public library career, so it would be important to be part of an organization such as the Association for Library Service to Children. </li>
        </ul>
